**Step 1**- HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.
**Step 2** - The h1 through <h6> heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so <h2> elements have less importance than <h1> elements. Only use one <h1> element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings. 
**Step 3** - The <p> element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. 
**Step 4** - Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment <!-- TODO: Remove h1 --> contains the text TODO: Remove h1.
